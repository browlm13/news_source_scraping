We’ll keep you posted if that changes.\\n\\n\\n\\nARIZONA: SPOILER ALERT\\n\\nCompetitive races for Senate, governor, one key House district\\n\\nAll polls close by 10 p.m. EDT\\n\\nIt’s hard to say who exactly the spoiler is in the Arizona GOP Senate primary, but you’d probably have to give the title to former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\\n\\nThe 86-year-old recipient of a preemptive pardon from President Trump never seemed to mount a serious campaign. But he’s still been good for consistent double-digit polling numbers. Having been the limelight-loving sheriff of the state’s most populous county for 24 years and a longtime ally of Trump (dating back to their failed effort to prove Barack Obama was a stealth Kenyan) has its advantages in an Arizona GOP primary.\\n\\nRemember, we expect to see more than half of the votes overall tonight come from Maricopa County, but the skew is even stronger among Republicans. The state GOP is heavily reliant on the suburbs north of Phoenix, places like Scottsdale and Surprise. Democrats do better with the large number of Native American voters who tend to dominate in rural counties to the North and with Hispanic voters around Tucson to the south.\\n\\nSo it would be easy to say that Arpaio, who is hogging the GOP breadbasket but not otherwise running a credible effort, looks like the spoiler here. But that would mean there was something to spoil. And in this case, that’s not entirely clear.\\n\\nIf Kelli Ward, a former state Senator from a screaming-red district near the California border, does as polls suggest and falls flat in her second straight attempt to win a Republican Senate primary, she and her supporters will be tempted to blame Arpaio. That will be especially true if Ward and Arpaio’s combined vote totals are equal or greater than those of expected winner, Rep. Martha McSally.\\n\\nAnd Arpaio and his campaign have certainly seemed to be on a seek-and-destroy mission against Ward in the closing days of the campaign. They accuse Ward of shady tactics and dishonest claims, charges Ward and her team vigorously deny. “Fake news” counterclaims abound. Life on the alt-right went alt-wrong.\\n\\nSo it would be easy to shape the race up to be a story about how a MAGA-nation divided against itself cannot MAGA, we’ll be looking at the results to see if that’s really so.\\n\\nThe worst thing that happened to Ward wasn’t Arpaio’s moseying, t rather the departure of Sen. Jeff Flake, who did Republicans a huge favor and dropped out not long after Ward announced her challenge. Flake might have survived the challenge, but the anti-Trump incumbent wouldn’t have done anything like the 11-point pasting John McCain laid on Ward in her first insurgent run.\\n\\nAnd in a state that is getting bluer and bluer, a cash-drained, primary-weakened Flake would have been in big trouble in the general. Or, worse for Republican Senate hopes, Ward might have pulled off the upset, which would have been (and still would be) essentially ceding the general election to presumptive Democratic nominee, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.\\n\\nWard would rival Republican’s Virginia Senate nominee for biggest albatross of 2018. She elevates conspiracy theories every bit as lurid as the ones Arpaio once sold about Obama and managed in one weekend to first accuse McCain of timing his death to harm her candidacy and then seemed to say that she was a victim of political correctness as aggressive as the brain cancer that killed the senator. She ended up apologizing, but every Republican who watched her stumble after stumble ought to raise a glass to Flake, whose departure seems to have staved off a disaster that would have had implications far beyond Arizona.\\n\\nMcSally, who represents the Republican-leaning suburbs east of Tucson, would have her hands full with Sinema, a centrist whose district takes in Democratic strongholds near Phoenix like Tempe and Mesa but also some swing precincts to the north around Scottsdale. But without McSally, Republicans would begin their Senate defense effort minus one.\\n\\nWhat’s worth watching tonight beyond just who wins the nod is how the numbers shake out. Ward doesn’t have the advantage that she did in 2016 of running with a competitive presidential primary at the top of the ticket. Tonight we’ll get to see how much of Ward’s 40 percent against McCain two years ago was coattails from Trump and how much is her own claim on the state party faithful.\\n\\nThat will be more than a little consequential for Republicans facing not just tough Senate and gubernatorial races this year but for the state’s status as a potential battleground in 2020 and beyond. The very fact that McSally’s House district is probably already a lost cause for the GOP tells you something about that, too.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, keep an eye on the Democratic gubernatorial contest tonight. If David Garcia, a former state education official and liberal activist, manages to upset the more moderate state Sen. Steve Farley, incumbent Republican Gov. Doug Ducey will breathe a sigh of relief as wide as the Grand Canyon.\\n\\nFLORIDA: WHOSE SWAMP IS THIS ANYWAY?\\n\\nCompetitive races for governor, six key House districts\\n\\nAll polls close by 8 p.m. EDT\\n\\n\\n\\nHow good is the Republican operation in Florida? Deep-red Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia have all elected Democratic governors more recently than swing state Florida.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere hasn’t been a Democrat elected governor there in 20 years. During two decades when the Sunshine State was usually right at the 50-yard line of American politics, Republicans have managed to hold the line in Tallahassee.\\n\\nThe organization that Jeb Bush built has weathered massive demographic changes, a deadlocked presidential vote, a party-switching governor, ugly primaries and much more. But will it survive 2018?\\n\\nAdam Putnam is the embodiment of the Florida GOP machine. He started young, paid his dues at the statehouse, moved up to Congress and then came home to win twice statewide as agriculture commissioner, a big job in a big agriculture state.\\n\\nPutnam didn’t just mark time either. He has out-hustled, out-campaigned and just plain out-worked all of his peers to get to what was supposed to be his crowning glory this year. There isn’t a Republican hangout from a Cuban coffee shop in Hialeah to a GOP women’s club in Pensacola where he hasn’t gripped, grinned and remembered the names for next time.\\n\\nBut much like it was for Bush, whose disastrous 2016 presidential campaign Putnam backed, the textbook isn’t working so well this time.\\n\\nPutnam opened with an early lead over Rep. Ron DeSantis, a relative unknown from a district south of Jacksonville. He had no network and limited contacts in the state party. But he did have one thing: the ability to use his position on the House oversight committee to get on television.\\n\\nIn hearings and in guest appearance after guest appearance, DeSantis, a former Navy lawyer, made himself one of the sharpest foes of the Justice Department or anything else that seemed to threaten Donald Trump. DeSantis joined a small group of House Republicans who were undermining prosecutors pursuing Trump associates even before the White House had figured out the play.\\n\\nThe president noticed and it made DeSantis a favorite of the commander in chief. That led to an endorsement, which helped draw in big bucks from fellow MAGAists outside Florida and then an ad campaign blitz in which DeSantis has run as Trump’s protector in Washington who will be his mini-me in Tallahassee.\\n\\nIt worked well in a state where Trump keeps a residence and is over-the-moon popular. With the ad money and Trump’s vigorous backing, DeSantis blew past Putnam in the polls and seemed poised to cruise to victory.\\n\\nBut in the closing weeks of the race, polls started showing Putnam gaining ground. His knock on DeSantis as a lightweight on state issues better suited to TV greenrooms than governing started to take hold. More significantly, Putnam started reaping the benefits of all of those thousands of hours of sweat equity he earned in the GOP.\\n\\nWhere DeSantis has all but no ground game, Putnam and his big organization have blanketed the state, door by door, phone call by phone call. Is it enough to overcome a Trump endorsement? The president’s preferred candidates had been on a hot streak until last week when Trump’s man fell flat in a Wyoming gubernatorial run, so you’d have to still call DeSantis the favorite.\\n\\nDemocrats are certainly hoping for DeSantis so they can make the general election a referendum on Trump, who polls show has faded in popularity with voters overall since his narrow 2016 victory there.\\n\\nThe Blue Team seems to have settled on former Rep. Gwen Graham, a moderate Democrat and daughter of Bob Graham, a popular two-term governor and senator who retired in 2005 after a 40-year run in state politics. The race has been a six-way goat roping, though, and Graham may have led in so many polls simply because she has a recognizable name.\\n\\nOutgoing Gov. Rick Scott has steer clear of the Putnam-DeSantis fracas. Scott is a shoo-in tonight for the Republican nod to take on Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, in what promises to be one of the roughest and most expensive Senate races of the year.\\n\\nHis focus of late has been to present himself as a pragmatic problem solver who can get results in a gridlocked Senate, a nod to the climate he expects to face this fall.\\n\\nTHE RULEBOOK: GETTING TO KNOW YOU\\n\\n“The more intimate the nature of such a union may be, the greater interest have the members in the political institutions of each other; and the greater right to insist that the forms of government under which the compact was entered into should be SUBSTANTIALLY maintained.” – James Madison, Federalist No. 43\\n\\nTIME OUT: ‘I HAVE A DREAM TODAY’\\n\\nHistory: “[On this day in 1963] on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., the African American civil rights movement reaches its high-water mark when Martin Luther King, Jr., speaks to about 250,000 people attending the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. … The peaceful rally was the largest assembly for a redress of grievances that the capital had ever seen, and King was the last speaker. With the statue of Abraham Lincoln–the Great Emancipator–towering behind him, King used the rhetorical talents he had developed as a Baptist preacher to show how, as he put it, the ‘Negro is still not free.’ He told of the struggle ahead, stressing the importance of continued action and nonviolent protest. Coming to the end of his prepared text (which, like other speakers that day, he had limited to seven minutes), he was overwhelmed by the moment and launched into an improvised sermon. … Continuing, he began the refrain that made the speech one of the best known in U.S. history, second only to Lincoln’s 1863 ‘Gettysburg Address’: ‘I have a dream…’”\\n\\n\\n\\nFlag on the play? - Email us at\\n\\nHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\\n\\nSCOREBOARD\\n\\nTrump job performance\\n\\nAverage approval: 42.8 percent\\n\\nAverage disapproval: 52.8 percent\\n\\nNet Score: -10 points\\n\\nChange from one week ago: down 0.2 points\\n\\n[Average includes: NBC/WSJ: 44% approve - 52% disapprove; Gallup: 41% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 45% approve - 53% disapprove; Monmouth University: 43% approve - 51% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 41% approve - 54% disapprove.]\\n\\nControl of House\\n\\nRepublican average: 41.2 percent\\n\\nDemocratic average: 50 percent\\n\\nAdvantage: Democrats plus 8.8 points\\n\\nChange from one week ago: Democratic advantage up 2 points\\n\\n[Average includes: NBC/WSJ: 50% Dems - 42% GOP; Fox News: 49% Dems - 38% GOP; Monmouth University: 48% Dems - 43% GOP; Quinnipiac University: 51% Dems - 42% GOP; CNN: 52% Dems - 41% GOP.]\\n\\n\\n\\nPOLL SHOWS WALKER BEHIND\\n\\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel: “Just under half the Wisconsin electorate (48%) thinks the state is heading in the right direction. Just under half (48%) approves of the job GOP Gov. Scott Walker is doing. And just under half (44%) backs Walker for re-election against Democratic challenger Tony Evers. Those numbers all come from a new statewide poll of 500 likely voters by Suffolk University, conducted for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Are they good enough to get Walker re-elected? Only the Nov. 6 election will tell. Walker trails Evers 44% to 46% in the new Suffolk poll, a difference well within the margin of error. The latest survey is consistent with the findings of other pollsters on the two-term governor in at least two respects. First, the Republican Walker is in greater danger of losing his job right now than the other big-name incumbent on the Wisconsin ballot this fall, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Baldwin leads her GOP opponent Leah Vukmir 50% to 42% in the Suffolk poll. … [But] Baldwin also has a more positive image than Walker in the Suffolk survey. … Both Walker and Baldwin have nearly universal support in their own party and almost no support in the opposing party.”\\n\\nClub for Growth rides to rescue for Cruz - Politico: “Republicans are sounding the alarm about Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s closer-than-expected reelection contest, with an influential conservative group racing to his aid. The Club for Growth, a Washington-based anti-tax group, is drawing up plans for a major TV ad campaign boosting Cruz — the first such intervention by a Republican outside group in this race. The move comes as Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke, an online fundraising behemoth who has attracted national support, continues to narrow the gap in polling. David McIntosh, the Club for Growth’s president, said on Tuesday the organization is planning a seven-figure-plus offensive targeting O’Rourke. McIntosh was speaking from Texas, where he is meeting with pro-Cruz donors who could help fund the effort. ‘In the last five weeks, it’s become clear that the race has tightened,’ said McIntosh.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCourt rules N.C. districts to be redrawn before November - [Raleigh] News and Observer: “A ruling by a panel of federal judges Monday raised the potential of drawing new congressional districts before November’s general election in North Carolina, or redrawing the districts and holding a new primary election in November and a general election before a new Congress is seated in January. The ruling by a three-judge panel, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, found in favor of plaintiffs Common Cause and the League of Women Voters of North Carolina, who claimed that the partisan gerrymander of congressional districts was unconstitutional. ‘The General Assembly expressly directed the legislators and consultant responsible for drawing the 2016 Plan to rely on ‘political data’ … to draw a districting plan that would ensure Republican candidates would prevail in the vast majority of the State’s congressional districts, and would continue to do so in future elections,’ the court wrote.”\\n\\n\\n\\nLame duck Jenkins trades House seat for state Supreme Court bench - Roll Call: “When Rep. Evan Jenkins, who lost a bid for the Republican Senate nomination in West Virginia earlier this year, resigns from Congress in the coming days, his seat will remain vacant until January, West Virginia’s elections director told The Charleston Gazette-Mail. Jenkins was appointed by Gov. Jim Justice to fill a vacancy on the West Virginia Supreme Court last week after the state’s House of Delegates voted to impeach Justice Robin Davis, who resigned after the vote. Jenkins is just a few days into a 20-day waiting period for groups and state politicians to file objections to his appointment. After he clears that waiting period, he will resign his post as the congressman for West Virginia’s 3rd District and be confirmed as the newest state Supreme Court justice. The seat Jenkins leaves behind ‘will remain vacant until the successor is elected, certified and takes the congressional oath of office on Jan. 3, 2019,’ Donald Kersey, who oversees elections and serves as deputy legal counsel for the West Virginia secretary of state, told the Gazette-Mail.”\\n\\n\\n\\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS RETURN EARLY FOR DOJ, FBI GRILLING\\n\\nRoll Call: “Some House Republicans are coming back to Washington a week early to conduct closed-door interviews with three current and former senior officials at the Justice Department and FBI this week, starting Tuesday morning with former associate deputy attorney general Bruce Ohr, GOP have sources confirmed. The interviews are part of the Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform Committees’ joint probe into potential abuses of power and misdeeds within the DOJ over the course of its investigations into Hillary Clinton’s private email server and possible ties between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia. The president has embarked on a crusade to crush Ohr's credibility in recent days, calling the longtime FBI official and his wife a ‘disgrace.’ Members of the House GOP have accused top DOJ officials of misleading Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act judges on applications for warrants to monitor the foreign contacts of Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Page was no longer with the campaign by the time the FBI began listening to his conversations with foreign nationals.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd they’re not a fan of Trump’s trade deal - Weekly Standard: “Congressional Republicans disregarded President Donald Trump's announcement Monday that he would pursue a bilateral trade deal with Mexico unless Canadian negotiators quickly agree to a framework for an updated trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement, arguing that his plan may not even be possible due to procedural constraints. ‘That would be almost impossible as it's been described to me,’ said Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson when asked about Trump’s plan. … Because the White House has to notify Congress 90 days in advance of signing an agreement, negotiators have only until Friday to strike a deal if they want to finish a new NAFTA before current Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto is replaced by left-wing president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in early December. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland is set to appear in Washington to meet with negotiators on Tuesday, but it remains to be seen just how flexible the Canadians are willing to be on a number of politically-sensitive issues, such as dairy tariffs.”\\n\\n\\n\\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\\n\\nCohen lawyer admits he was anonymous CNN source on Trump Tower meeting - Fox News\\n\\n\\n\\nMd.

The very people who cleared Clinton of crimes – despite strong evidence that she broke the law – also assumed unfettered authority over the so-called “collusion” investigation to determine if Donald Trump’s presidential campaign worked with Russia to help Trump become president.\\n\\nBereft of probable cause and credible evidence, they nevertheless pursued Trump in a probe designed to damage his candidacy – and later to destroy his presidency in an effort to overturn the results of the 2016 presidential election.\\n\\nIt was not just Comey and his abettors at the FBI who conjured this illicit scheme. There were others outside the walls of the J. Edgar Hoover Building who were both instrumental and complicit.\\n\\nClinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee furnished the necessary funds. Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS acted as the facilitator. And ex-British spy Christopher Steele provided the fabricated “dossier” that served as a pretext for launching the investigation of Trump.\\n\\nThis brings us to the steps of the Justice Department and a high-ranking official who was essential to the scheme.\\n\\nBruce Ohr\\n\\nAssociate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr bypassed his superiors at the Justice Department and worked covertly with Steele to exploit what became known as the “Steele dossier.” Sixty-three pages of texts, emails and handwritten notes show extensive contacts between Ohr and Steele both before and after the election.\\n\\nEven after Steele was fired by the FBI for lying about his contacts with reporters, Ohr maintained intensive communications with Steele. The former British spy kept feeding his bogus information while simultaneously fretting to Ohr that his actions might be “exposed.”\\n\\nIt was a direct violation of FBI procedures to use a discredited source who had also broken an agreement with the FBI. To circumvent its rules, the bureau used Ohr as a conduit to continue its relationship with Steele.\\n\\nIt appears that Ohr would communicate with Steele, then endeavor to pass on the information to the FBI. Peter Strzok, the FBI’s lead investigator in the Trump-Russia probe, confirmed in his congressional testimony that “the FBI received documents and material from Mr. Ohr.”\\n\\nOhr knew that Steele was a nefarious and unreliable character. Records show that in September of 2016 Steele told Ohr that he was “desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.”\\n\\nGiven such an acute bias and motivation to lie, all contact with Steele should have been terminated and his “dossier” tossed in the garbage. However, both Ohr and the FBI were determined to use Steele and his unverified documents to damage Trump.\\n\\nIt is important to note that Steele was not only receiving money from the Clinton campaign. He was also on the payroll of the FBI from January 1, 2016 to November 1, 2016. Records obtained by Judicial Watch through a lawsuit reveal that he was paid eleven times when he met with the FBI.\\n\\nThus, it appears the FBI and Clinton’s campaign were working in concert to use a discredited source, who composed a fictitious document to harm her political opponent in the 2016 election.\\n\\nIronically, Clinton and her campaign are not being investigated for violating campaign laws. Her payments to a foreign source constituted a “thing of value” which is illegal under the Federal Election Campaign Act. In egregious cases like this one, it is a crime.\\n\\nJuxtapose Clinton’s actions to the recent accusations against President Trump for personally funding payments that were perfectly legal under election laws. The disparity of treatment proves that equal justice under the law is a charade when partisan politics prevail.\\n\\nDocuments also show that Steele kept feeding the FBI allegations about Trump – even after Trump became president – all the way through May 15, 2017. Why? It is reasonable to conclude that the FBI was desperate to verify the unverified “dossier.” The material from Steele served as the basis for launching its Trump-Russia investigation and the foundation of its warrant to wiretap a Trump campaign associate.\\n\\nHaving violated FBI regulations by using unverified information in a warrant application and thereby committing a fraud on the court, the FBI was hoping to cure its wrongdoing belatedly. It’s called covering your tracks.\\n\\nIt is not surprising the FBI was never able to corroborate or substantiate anything contained in the “dossier.” In British court documents, Steele was forced to admit under oath that his claims against Trump were derived from “raw intelligence” based on “limited intelligence” – casting doubt on their veracity.\\n\\nSteele further acknowledged that his accusations were “unverifiable.” In other words, the “dossier” was so poorly sourced that it was inherently untrustworthy. The contents were based on triple and quadruple hearsay from “anonymous” sources that probably never existed in the first place. It was a clever illusion.\\n\\nIn a veiled reference to the partisan motivations behind his report, Steele cautioned that “its contents must be critically viewed in light of the purpose for and circumstances in which the information was collected.”\\n\\nThis was a subtle way for Steele to confess that his work was not worth the paper on which it was written. In plain language, it was an untruthful political attack intended to vilify an opposing candidate – Donald Trump. Ohr and the FBI plainly knew this. They didn’t care.\\n\\nNellie Ohr\\n\\nBruce Ohr was peddling the false Steele document while benefiting from it financially. His wife, Nellie Ohr, worked on the “dossier” as an employee of Fusion GPS and was getting paid to do so by the Clinton campaign. Money was going into the Ohrs’ bank account at the same time Bruce Ohr was using his position at the Justice Department to advance this false intelligence document.\\n\\nSince his wife worked for Fusion GPS and contributed to the “dossier,” the relationship presented a disqualifying conflict of interest for Ohr. He was legally obligated under Justice Department regulations to recuse himself from any investigation in which his wife was involved.\\n\\nOhr did not seek a waiver of the conflict of interest. Instead, he omitted this information. Upon joining the Justice Department, he had signed an agreement stating that he would be fired for violating its rules. Inexplicably, he was not terminated, which only reinforces the impression that impropriety and concealment continued at the highest levels of the department.\\n\\nNot only did Bruce Ohr fail to disclose that Fusion GPS was paying his wife, but it appears he did not fully report the nature of the work performed in financial disclosure reports as required under Justice Department regulations. Willfully filing a false government report constitutes a crime under federal law – specifically 8 U.S.C. (United States Code) 1001.\\n\\nIt is also against the law to use a public official for personal financial gain. This runs afoul of the federal bribery and gratuity statutes (18 U.S.C. 201-b and 18 U.S.C. 201-c) and is a violation of the honest services fraud statute (18 U.S. C. 1346). These are serious felonies. Yet, there appears to be no known investigation of Ohr by the Justice Department, where he is still employed.\\n\\nJeff Sessions\\n\\nIs it any wonder that President Trump continues to express impatience, disgust and frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions?\\n\\nSessions has failed to take aggressive action against those who appear to have broken the law with impunity. He ignored pleas from members of Congress to reopen the Clinton email case, including her destruction of documents under congressional subpoena.\\n\\nThere is no investigation of Clinton’s payments to a foreigner who was using Russian sources for the “dossier”. The actions of Comey, McCabe, Strzok and others should have been presented to a grand jury. Abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to gain wiretap warrants should have been pursued.\\n\\nInstead, of doing these things, Sessions spent months obstructing Congress by refusing to produce documents in response to lawful subpoenas.\\n\\nSessions’ only real achievement as attorney general has been to alienate his boss by his actions and inactions. President Trump was right when he said that choosing Sessions as attorney general was one of the “worst” decision he made.\\n\\nSessions should take the hint. When you have lost the confidence and trust of the president, it is time to resign. In the alternative, President Trump should finally accept the letter of resignation that his attorney general submitted in May of last year. There was no time limit on the letter. It can be accepted at the president’s pleasure.\\n\\nIf not now, then Sessions should go after the midterm elections. Expect to see Sessions standing outside the Justice Department with a box of his office tchotchkes. I’m betting it does not include the Scales of Justice.\"}, {'news_source_id': 'fox-news', 'title': 'Shoppers showing no fear about hitting stores this summer', 'description': 'Consumer confidence soaring in August to highest level since October 2000.

Using uncharacteristically strong language for the Vatican, even on such serious issues as child abuse, the Holy See spokesman said to victims that “the pope is on their side.”\\n\\nVatican spokesman Greg Burke said the incidents of abuse graphically documented in the grand jury report were “betrayals of trust that robbed survivors of their dignity and their faith.”\\n\\n“The church must learn hard lessons from its past, and there should be accountability for both abusers and those who permitted abuse to occur,” he said.\\n\\nPOPE\\'S ALLEGED COVER-UP PIVOTS ON WHEN, IF SANCTIONS IMPOSED\\n\\nBut for many Catholics and long-time Vatican observers, the acknowledgment of the criminal behavior was too little, too late.\\n\\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation, a group that describes itself as agnostics and atheists (including former Catholics) are running a full-page ad later this week in The New York Times urging people to leave the Church.\\n\\n“Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all,” the ad says. “Six dioceses, three hundred predatory priests, a staggering 1,000-plus victims. No bishops indicted. The pope’s response? All words, no action — except, insultingly, to call on the faithful to ‘pray and fast.’”\\n\\nThe advert in the Times comes after Francis was taken to task on Sunday by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the former Vatican ambassador to the U.S.\\n\\nPOPE REFUSES TO COMMENT ON CLAIMS HE IGNORED MCCARRICK ABUSE ACCUSATIONS\\n\\nIn a damning 11-page letter released to ultra-conservative media in Europe, during the pope’s trip to Ireland over the weekend, Vigano accused the pontiff of being among Church hierarchy who knew – and did little or nothing towards disciplining – about rumored sexual indiscretions by ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick.\\n\\nIn fact, Vigano asserted, McCarrick was rehabilitated from sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI, promoted and made part of high-profile Vatican events even as rumors about him swirled.\\n\\nThe timing of Vigano’s accusations have been seen by the progressive pope’s supporters as a deliberate attempt by more conservative factions to undermine his tenure, which has seen him reach out to homosexuals and divorce parishioners.\\n\\nFORMER VATICAN DIPLOMAT CALLS FOR POPE FRANCIS TO RESIGN, CLAIMS HE IGNORED SEX ABUSE ALLEGATIONS\\n\\nCompounding matters, Francis told reporters on Sunday that he \"won\\'t say a word\" aby viagno\\'s memo, saying it \"speaks for itself\".\\n\\nFrancis burst onto the global stage as a papal rock star of sorts in 2013, with people dubbing him a breath of fresh air. The first South American-born pope routinely went to prisons and washed inmates’ feet, spoke to the homeless, and expressed respect and fondness for those cast aside by society.\\n\\nDavid Gibson, a former veteran religion writer and now director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University, says the backlash against Francis for the slower than preferred response to the abuse allegations is “unfair.”\\n\\nGibson said that Francis, admittedly, has been on a learning curb as far as dealing with a decades-old crisis of sex abuse by priests and high-ranking church officials.\\n\\n“He seems to be too much a creature of the Old Church,” Gibson said. “But he’s been better than his predecessors. He believed in churchman before victims. He moved very carefully, giving deference to the church. That was evident in Chile, and the sex abuse allegations there.”\\n\\nFrancis defended a bishop in his home country who was accused by victims of knowing about and ignoring abuse they suffered.\\n\\nThen, he did an about-face, practically forcing Chilean bishops to resign for their “grave defects” in handling the abuse reports.\\n\\nFurthermore, Francis accused them of destroying evidence, obstructing justice and putting children in harm’s way around pedophiles.\\n\\nThe move was noted as the first such time the Vatican initiated a bold action to hold bishops accountable for covering up sex abuse, and it did it very publicly.\\n\\n“Pope Francis wrote a very heartfelt apology, he said ‘I was wrong and I must change,’” Gibson said. “No pope ever had fired a bishop.”\\n\\nThe scandals increasingly coming to the surface are “a legacy he inherited from the last 60 years.”\\n\\nHowever, that does not excuse Pope Francis from slow responses now, Gibson said.\\n\\n“He is the pope, so it’s his responsibility to fix it.”\\n\\nVictims and their advocates for decades have lamented that top Catholic churchmen repeatedly put the reputation of the church ahead of obligations to protect children from harm from pedophile priests.\\n\\nGroups of Catholic abuse survivors say swift and public actions are needed immediately to change the culture in dioceses and parishes that allow such abuses to still occur.\\n\\n“As he arrived in Ireland Pope Francis has once again missed another opportunity to seriously and concretely tell the world what he is going to do about the child sexual abuse and cover up crisis,” said Peter Isely, founding member of Ending Clergy Abuse (ECA), a worldwide organization of abuse survivors and human rights activists who calling on Roman Catholic Church to end clergy abuse. “This crisis is a global crisis. It not only effects Ireland, where there has been so much suffering, but in every corner of the globe where the Catholic Church is present.”\\n\\n“What is most important about the Pope’s speech is what he did not say. He did not say that he will change church law so that any priest who has sexually abused a child will be permanently removed from ministry,” Isely said. “He did not say that any bishop who has been proven to have covered up sex crimes will be removed from office. Until he at least says and does that, nothing else he says and does will be effective in ending the crisis.”'}, {'news_source_id': 'fox-news', 'title': 'Likely Lula replacement denies corruption charges in Brazil', 'description': \"The man in line to replace jailed presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as the Brazilian Workers' Party standard-bearer on Tuesday denied accusations of corruption.\", 'url': 'http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/08/28/likely-lula-replacement-denies-corruption-charges-in-brazil.html', 'text': 'next\\n\\nprev\\n\\nThe man in line to replace jailed presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as the Brazilian Workers\\' Party standard-bearer on Tuesday denied accusations of corruption.\\n\\nProsecutors accuse Fernando Haddad of receiving indirect payments to his 2012 campaign for Sao Paulo mayor.\\n\\nConstruction company UTC Engenharia got preferential treatment on bids after covering about US$1.6 million of debt associated with Haddad\\'s campaign, according to a former accusation filed Monday.
