Army and Navy Seabees were also involved in the construction effort.\\n\\nGOOGLE LAUNCHES NEW SEARCH TOOL TO HELP VETERANS GET CIVILIAN JOBS\\n\\nHarnessing the world’s largest concrete printer, the Additive Manufacturing Team at Marine Corps Systems Command teamed up with Marines from I Marine Expeditionary Force.\\n\\n“This exercise had never been done before,” said Capt. Matthew Friedell, Additive Manufacturing project officer in MCSC’s Operations and Programs/G-3, in a statement. “People have printed buildings and large structures, but they haven’t done it onsite and all at once. This is the first-in-the-world, onsite continuous concrete print.”\\n\\nUsing Computer Aided Design software on a 10-year-old computer, the concrete was pushed through a print head and layered repeatedly to build the barracks room walls. Friedell said that the job took 40 hours because Marines were carefully monitoring the project and continually filling the printer with concrete. However, if a robot was used to do the mixing and pumping, the building could be built in 24 hours, he added.\\n\\nAIR FORCE 'INNOVATION HUB' LOOKS TO HELP TECH STARTUPS\\n\\nNormally, it takes 10 Marines five days to construct a barracks hut out of wood.\\n\\nSet against this backdrop, the construction technology could help keep U.S. military personnel safe.\\n\\n“In active or simulated combat environments, we don’t want Marines out there swinging hammers and holding plywood up,” said Friedell. “Having a concrete printer that can make buildings on demand is a huge advantage for Marines operating down range.”\\n\\nVA REENLISTS IBM'S WATSON IN FIGHT AGAINST CANCER\\n\\nMore testing will now be done on the Marines’ new barracks-building technology.\\n\\nThe construction industry is keen to tap into the power of 3D-printing. Last year, for example, experts at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands produced the world’s first 3D-printed reinforced, pre-stressed concrete bridge. The cycle bridge is part of a new road around the village of Gemert in southern Holland.\\n\\nOne of the big advantages of 3D-printed concrete is that much less concrete is need compared to the traditional technique of filling a mold with concrete, according to experts from Eindhoven University of Technology. “By contrast, the printer deposits only the concrete where it is needed, which decreases the use of cement,” they said, in a statement. “This reduces CO 2 emissions, as cement production has a very high carbon footprint.”\\n\\nIn 2015, 3D-printing was used in the construction of a five-story apartment complex and an 11,840 square foot villa in Suzhou, China.\\n\\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers\"}, {'news_source_id': 'fox-news', 'title': \"Ancient 'alien' wasp laid eggs inside fly pupae, ate them from the inside out - Fox News\", 'description': 'Fox News Ancient \\'alien\\' wasp laid eggs inside fly pupae, ate them from the inside out Fox News It sounds like something out of the \"Alien\" movie series, but wasps that lived during the age of dinosaurs laid eggs inside fly pupae, with the wasps eating the fl…', 'url': 'http://www.foxnews.com/science/2018/08/29/ancient-alien-wasp-laid-eggs-inside-fly-pupae-ate-them-from-inside-out.html', 'text': 'It sounds like something out of the \"Alien\" movie series, but wasps that lived during the age of dinosaurs laid eggs inside fly pupae, with the wasps eating the flies from the inside out.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe study, published in the scientific journal Nature, revealed that four new wasp species were found inside fossil pupae that date back to the Paleogene period, approximately 65 million to 23 million years ago.

Here\\'s a look at details of the case:\\n\\nTHE CONTROVERSY\\n\\nBrazil\\'s top electoral court is expected to soon rule on whether leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva can run for president despite a corruption conviction. Nearly all experts expect the court to rule against him, throwing the presidential race in the Latin America\\'s largest nation into uncertainty.\\n\\nThat\\'s causing renewed scrutiny at home and abroad of the 238-page conviction for corruption and money laundering imposed in July 2017 by Brazil\\'s most famous judge.\\n\\nDa Silva says the conviction and 12-year sentence amount to a \"coup\" by right-wing forces trying to prevent his return to office. Detractors say he\\'s guilty and the nation can only move beyond a culture of endemic graft if the law applies to all.\\n\\nDa Silva has won support abroad from figures including former U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and U.N.-appointed human rights experts. Writing an op-ed in the New York Times this month, Jorge Castaneda, a former Mexican foreign minister, also argued that da Silva should be allowed to run despite the conviction.\\n\\n\"The charges brought against him are too flimsy, the purported crime so petty (until now), the sentence so brazenly disproportionate and the stakes so high that in Latin America today, democracy should trump — so to speak — the rule of law,\" he wrote.\\n\\nTHE CASE\\n\\nJudge Sergio Moro ruled that the former president helped steer contracts to construction company Grupo OAS before leaving office on Jan. 1, 2011.\\n\\nIn exchange, the judge said, da Silva was promised a renovated beachfront apartment worth about $1.1 million in Guaruja, a city outside of Sao Paulo.\\n\\nDa Silva backers argue there was no crime because neither he nor his late wife ever legally owned the apartment. Moro said the intent to give it to him made it a crime.\\n\\nWriting an op-ed in the New York Times this month, da Silva said the \"linchpin\" in the case against him was testimony from a man with a \"personal interest to tell authorities what they wanted to hear.\" Da Silva was referring to former OAS president Leo Pinheiro, who got a reduced sentence after testifying that he met with da Silva in 2014 to discuss giving him the apartment as a gift.\\n\\nLaw professor Maristela Basso of the University of Sao Paulo said that a plea bargain in Brazil \"has to be combined with other evidence\" to win conviction. \"So to say it was all based on Pinheiro is not true.\"\\n\\nTHE EVIDENCE\\n\\nWitnesses testifying against da Silva included other top officials from OAS and another construction company, a former senator from da Silva\\'s Workers\\' Party and a black-market money dealer at the center of the sprawling Carwash corruption investigation.\\n\\nProsecutors also presented text messages in which OAS executives discussed renovations on the apartment using code names \"boss\" and \"madam,\" allegedly referring to da Silva and his wife.\\n\\n\"The boss\\'s kitchen project is ready, so we can set up an appointment with madam whenever you want,\" Paulo Gordilho, then OAS director, told Pinheiro, according to the sentencing document.\\n\\nMoro noted that while OAS bought the building in 2009, it never put the unit in question up for sale or showed it to other potential buyers. Renovations to the apartment were made in 2014 after da Silva and his wife came to view it and before da Silva\\'s wife made a second visit herself. Moro\\'s decision says the work — which included installation of a sauna and increasing the size of a pool deck — is not the sort of renovation OAS typically does.\\n\\nThe deal apparently fell apart at some point in 2014, a time when Judge Moro and prosecutors were ramping up investigations into corruption in government contracts. Hundreds of businessmen and politicians, including many officials in da Silva\\'s 2003-2010 administrations, were implicated.\\n\\nDA SILVA\\'S VERSION\\n\\nThe former president acknowledged interest in buying the apartment as an investment, not receiving it as a gift. In his initial statements to investigators, da Silva said he decided against buying the apartment after his wife visited a second time in August 2014. He later changed that when testifying before Moro in 2017, saying he backed out after the couple\\'s initial visit — before the renovations began that the judge says were made for them.\\n\\nCristiano Zanin, one of da Silva\\'s attorneys, said the initial statements shouldn\\'t have been part of the evidence because they were made when the former president was \"illegally detained\" for six hours in early 2016.\\n\\nCONFIRMATION OR COINCIDENCE?\\n\\n\"The sentence is a jigsaw puzzle,\" said Rodrigo Falk Fragoso, a professor of criminal law at the Catholic Pontificate University in Rio de Janeiro. \"There isn\\'t one direct piece of evidence of the property being transferred, but rather a combination of indications that the judge considered enough to determine a crime had been committed.\"\\n\\nDID THE PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME?\\n\\nEven some who believe a conviction was warranted say the sentence is too long, largely because of the serious charge of money laundering.\\n\\nFrancisco Monteiro Rocha Junior, a law professor at the Federal University of Parana, argued that da Silva\\'s actions didn\\'t fit the legal definition of money laundering, which is hiding the origin of payments and using the money for lawful transactions in the future.\\n\\nStill, the sentence length is in line with others leveled by Moro against politicians from opposition parties, such as former House Speaker Eduardo Cunha, sentenced to 15 years for corruption.\\n\\nThe length of the sentence reduces the chances that da Silva could get out of prison in time to run for office. Da Silva and supporters argue that ensuring he can\\'t run has always been part of the plan by opponents.\\n\\nTHE APPEALS\\n\\nThe country\\'s top court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal, which includes justices appointed by da Silva, earlier this year narrowly rejected his petition to be released from prison while he appeals. And in January, an appeals court with three magistrates unanimously upheld the conviction, of 9 ½ years, and extended it to 12 years and 1 month.\\n\\n\"Lula says there is a judicial conspiracy,\" said Jovacy Peter Filho, a criminal lawyer in Espirito Santo who thinks overall the evidence was weak. \"But it\\'s harder to keep saying that after the appeals court upheld the conviction.\"'}, {'news_source_id': 'fox-news', 'title': 'Private and public ceremonies held honoring McCain', 'description': \"Speakers to honor McCain's memory at Arizona Capitol.

Whether you love them or you hate them, they’re constantly flooding our social media feeds.\\n\\nFor women it’s often about being seen as sexy or looking glamorous. But why?\\n\\nWell, researchers have figured it out. And the reason is not what you might think.\\n\\nUniversity of New South Wales researcher Khandis Blake says the next time you see a woman adjusting her bikini provocatively with her phone at the ready, don’t think of her as vacuous or a victim.\\n\\n“Think of her as a strategic player in a complex social and evolutionary game,” says Dr. Blake said.\\n\\nThe study revealed women tend to sexualize themselves in environments with greater economic inequality, rather than where they might be oppressed because of their gender.\\n\\nAnalyzing tens of thousands of social media posts across 113 countries, they tracked photos where people had taken selfies and then noted that they were tagged sexy, hot or similar.\\n\\n“We then looked at where in the world these things happened most,” Dr Blake explains.\\n\\n“The number one way that psychologists usually look at women’s preoccupation with their appearance is that it happens because of patriarchal pressures — that women live in societies that value their appearance more than their other qualities.\\n\\n“The argument is usually that when you see sexualization, you see disempowerment.\\n\\n“What we found instead is that women are more likely to invest time and effort into posting sexy selfies online in places where economic inequality is rising, and not in places where men hold more societal power and gender inequality is rife.”\\n\\nThe researchers say the findings are consistent across different geographic locations, even after taking into account and controlling for other factors that could influence patterns, like population size, human development and internet access.\\n\\nThey say income inequality increases competitiveness and status anxiety among people at all levels of the social hierarchy, making them sensitive to where they sit on the social ladder and wanting them to do better than others.\\n\\n“That income inequality is a big predictor of sexy selfies suggests that sexy selfies are a marker of social climbing among women that tracks economic incentives in the local environment,” Dr Blake says.\\n\\n“Rightly or wrongly, in today’s environment, looking sexy can generate large returns, economically, socially, and personally.”\\n\\nThe researchers then found the exact same pattern in real-world spending in other appearance-enhancing areas.\\n\\n“What we found in more than 1000 different economic areas in the US when looking at women’s spending in beauty salons and clothing stores is that income inequality is also predicting this type of spending,” Dr Blake says.\\n\\nThe researchers say that the findings make sense from an evolutionary point of view.\\n\\n“In evolutionary terms, these kinds of behaviors are completely rational, even adaptive,” he says.\\n\\n“The basic idea is that the way people compete for mates, and the things they do to put themselves at the top of the hierarchy are really important. This is where this research fits in — it’s all about how women are competing and why they’re competing.\\n\\n“So, when a young woman adjusts her bikini provocatively with her phone at the ready, don’t think of her as vacuous or as a victim. Think of her as a strategic player in a complex social and evolutionary game. She’s out to maximize her lot in life, just like everyone.”\\n\\nThis story originally appeared in news.com.au.'}, {'news_source_id': 'fox-news', 'title': 'White House Counsel Don McGahn to leave job after Kavanaugh confirmation vote, Trump says', 'description': 'White House Counsel Don McGahn plans to leave the Trump administration after the upcoming confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump said Wednesday.', 'url': 'http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/29/trump-says-white-house-counsel-don-mcgahn-to-leave-position-after-kavanaugh-confirmation.html', 'text': 'White House Counsel Don McGahn plans to leave the Trump administration after the upcoming confirmation vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump said Wednesday.\\n\\n“White House Counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his position in the fall, shortly after the confirmation (hopefully) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court,” Trump tweeted. “I have worked with Don for a long time and truly appreciate his service!”\\n\\nMcGahn’s departure had been expected.
